        A digital textbook is a digital book or e-book intended to serve as the text for a class. Digital textbooks may also be known as e-textbooks or e-texts. Digital textbooks are a major component of technology-based education reform. They may serve as the texts for a traditional face-to-face class, an online course or degree, or massive open online courses (MOOCs). As with physical textbooks, digital textbooks can be either rented for a term or purchased for lifetime access. While accessible, digital textbooks can be downloaded, printed, or accessed online via a compatible device.[1] To access content online, users must often use a 3rd party hosting provider or "digital bookshelf" through which digital textbooks can be served.

        There are many potential advantages to digital textbooks. They may offer lower costs, make it easier to monitor student progress, and are easier and cheaper to update when needed. Open source e-textbooks may offer the opportunity to create free, modifiable textbooks for basic subjects, or give individual teachers the opportunity to create e-texts for their own classrooms.[2] They may offer better access to quality texts in the developing world. For this reason, many schools and colleges around the world have made the implementation of digital textbooks a central component of education policy. For example, in South Korea, reading materials in all public schools will be digitized by 2015.[3] In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission aims for every student to be able to access e-texts by 2017.[4]

However, the transition to e-textbooks is costly, complex and controversial. Students express a strong preference for printed materials in many surveys and across cultures.[5][6] Many interconnected factors, from device access, to digital literacy, to teaching methods affect the implementation of digital textbooks in the classroom.[7] Issues of overall value, book quality, privacy, and intellectual property have yet to be resolved. An early 2009 study by Cleantech Group LLC also found that the emissions used to create an eBook were equivalent to 22.5 physical books, representing a significant improvement in environmental sustainability.[8] As of 2021, the largest supplier of digital textbooks is VitalSource, with over 1 million titles in its catalog.[9]
